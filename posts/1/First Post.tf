The clich√© first post, but not really. I've started and quit blogging several times since I bought this domain back in 2008. My last attempt was five years ago and it lasted just a few short posts and was replaced with a black blank page which remained unchanged until today.

Why start again? A lot has changed since '08. I'm now programming as a full time job instead of a night time hobby. Most of my day is spent in VBA/VBscript and SQL, but I've begun to brush up on my PHP skills for some new projects I've got in the works.

Most of my PHP knowledge came while building a web-based [MMORP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game) called [Knight's Adventure](http://web.archive.org/web/20070526053256/http://www.knightsadventure.com/login.php) back in 2006-2007. I'm not sure what *most* 15-16 year old boys do these days, but I know every waking hour that I wasn't at school, I was working on that game. It was my first experience with PHP, MySQL, VPS management, and even Linux for that matter. If you look hard enough on Google you can find me asking all sort of questions on various programming help forums. I still have plenty of questions and I'm not sure if its a product of my [google-fu](http://mashable.com/2011/11/24/google-search-infographic/#qAhlxEQvsGqu) getting better over the years or if the student has finally become the teacher. Today when I post to various help forums it's to answer someone's questions or at least point them to the StackOverflow answer.

My next post will go more into technical detail about this site, my hosting setup, and future plans for both.
