In my last post about the source code I should have mentioned where this blog layout came from. I've always been a big fan of minimalist designs. The following series are (mostly) satire, but as if you overlook the vulgar language, the designs are truly minimalistic and I think quite beautiful. 

 It all started with [MotherFuckingWebsite.com](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) and incrementally *"improved"* upon by:
 

 1. [BetterMotherFuckingWebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com)
 2. [BestMotherFucking.website](https://bestmotherfucking.website)
 3. [EvenBetterMotherFucking.website](http://evenbettermotherfucking.website)
 4. [TheBestMotherFucking.website](https://thebestmotherfucking.website)
 
And then there's the one to rule them all [TheBestMotherFuckingWebsite.com](http://thebestmotherfuckingwebsite.com), which I'm sure we all can agree is light-years ahead of any of the others.

I used the [BestMotherFucking.website](https://bestmotherfucking.website), but added my name in a centered &lt;H1&gt; tag at the top and changed all the post headers to &lt;H2&gt; tags with&lt;HR&gt;s between each post.
